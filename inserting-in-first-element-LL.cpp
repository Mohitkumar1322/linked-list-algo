Of course, I'd be happy to explain the code to you line by line in easy language:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

- This part includes the necessary libraries to use input/output functions like `cout` and `cin` for printing and reading data.

```cpp
class node {
public:
    int data;
    node *next;

    node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
```

- This is the declaration of a class named `node`. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. Here, `node` represents a node in a linked list.
- Inside the class, there are two things defined: `data` and `next`.
  - `data` holds the value of the node.
  - `next` is a pointer that will point to the next node in the linked list.
- The constructor `node(int val)` is used to create a new node and set its data to the given value (`val`). The `next` pointer is set to `NULL` initially.

```cpp
void insertAtTail(node* &head, int val) {
    node* n = new node(val);
    if (head == NULL) {
        head = n;
        return;
    }
    node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = n;
}
```

- This function is used to insert a new node with a given value at the end of the linked list.
- `node* &head` is a reference to a pointer. It represents the head (starting) node of the linked list.
- `node* n = new node(val);` creates a new node with the given value.
- If the linked list is empty (the head is `NULL`), the new node becomes the head.
- Otherwise, a temporary pointer `temp` is used to traverse the linked list until the last node (`temp->next` is `NULL`).
- Once the last node is reached, the new node `n` is attached to the `next` pointer of the last node.

```cpp
void display(node* head) {
    node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        cout << temp->data << " -> ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << "NULL" << endl;
}
```

- This function is used to display the linked list.
- `node* head` is the starting node of the linked list.
- A temporary pointer `temp` is used to traverse the linked list.
- The loop continues until `temp` becomes `NULL`, which means we've reached the end of the linked list.
- During each iteration, it prints the data of the current node and moves to the next node.
- After the loop, "NULL" is printed to indicate the end of the linked list.

```cpp
int main() {
    node* head = NULL;
    insertAtTail(head, 1);
    display(head);
    return 0;
}
```

- This is the main function where the program execution starts.
- It begins by creating an empty linked list with `head` initialized to `NULL`.
- Then, it calls the `insertAtTail` function to insert a node with the value `1` into the linked list.
- Finally, it calls the `display` function to show the contents of the linked list, including the value `1` that was inserted. The output will look like `1 -> NULL`.
- The `return 0;` indicates that the program has executed successfully and is returning a status code of `0`.
